Have you learnt the basics of ASP.NET Core and Angular?  Not sure where to go next?  This course should be able to help with that.  In this course we start from nothing and incrementally build up our API and Angular front end until we have a fully functional Web Application that we then publish to IIS and a Linux server. These are 2 of the hottest frameworks right now for the ‘back-end’ (Microsoft’s ASP.NET Core) and the ‘front-end’ (Google’s Angular) and are well worth spending the time to learn. In this course we build a complete application from start to finish and every line of code is demonstrated and explained. This course is right up to date as at November 2019 using ASP.NET Core 3.0 and Angular v8 and as these frameworks evolve, this course will evolve with it.","tags":[".NET","Angular","Full Stack Web Development"],"image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/57e3a1e665d3f14a430a22b81cbf14ea/89336/build-an-app-with-aspnet-core-and-angular-from-scratch.jpg","srcSet":"/static/57e3a1e665d3f14a430a22b81cbf14ea/82c2b/build-an-app-with-aspnet-core-and-angular-from-scratch.jpg 100w,\n/static/57e3a1e665d3f14a430a22b81cbf14ea/8eb08/build-an-app-with-aspnet-core-and-angular-from-scratch.jpg 200w,\n/static/57e3a1e665d3f14a430a22b81cbf14ea/89336/build-an-app-with-aspnet-core-and-angular-from-scratch.jpg 400w","sizes":"(min-width: 400px) 400px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/57e3a1e665d3f14a430a22b81cbf14ea/b6a46/build-an-app-with-aspnet-core-and-angular-from-scratch.webp 100w,\n/static/57e3a1e665d3f14a430a22b81cbf14ea/619d6/build-an-app-with-aspnet-core-and-angular-from-scratch.webp 200w,\n/static/57e3a1e665d3f14a430a22b81cbf14ea/549e4/build-an-app-with-aspnet-core-and-angular-from-scratch.webp 400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 400px) 400px, 100vw"}]},"width":400,"height":225}}},"createdAt":"November 29th 2021","updatedAt":"November 29th 2021"},"excerpt":"A practical example of how to build an application with ASP.NET Core API and Angular from start to finish What Will I Learn?
