Along with this we will use a payment gateway to configure our t-shirt selling store. Full Stack web development is really high in demand and in this course, we are bringing 2 of the most popular programming languages together, Python and JavaScript. We will start by installing python and a virtual environment. After that we will install Django and will work on backend. We are using a scalable approach of dividing project into multiple Django apps. Further we will create API from our backend so that in future you can modify front end without any issues.
