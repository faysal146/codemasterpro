**Direct downloadable links?**

No, DMCA issues! Uploading on a cloud storage or any file hosting services will create DMCA issues and soon they’ll get deleted on legal terms right after every single upload, Team-FTU is not big, they cannot re-upload each and every-time a file gets deleted. Torrent is good, be a good lad! Do not leech, It’s a matter of education, SEED WELL!!!

**Seed not available? Not able to download?**

Team-FTU cannot help you with that! All torrents are well seeded at 101 ratio, sometimes more… #TIP – Subscribe to the push notification, be a subscriber and get yourself early notified on newly posted courses. Grab em fast before they loose the seed-box! That’s all.

**Do you even read emails?**

Yes, we do… Each and every email! Better keep your requests away! Suggestion and jokes are always welcome!

**Why you never replied to my emails?**

Lazy! But we do read em…

**Course request?**

Course requests on email are always overlooked by Team-FTU! Request here if you want to >>>

**When my requested course will be posted on FTU?**

We look at the bulk requests and Rip courses accordingly, the higher number of times a single course is being requested by too many FTU’ers, that course will get posted first, so request for once and leave, let others also request the same course. If you keep requesting the same course over and over again or after a period of time on any request page or on our email, then seriously, we won’t be able to consider that single course, because it’s a stubborn behavior, we cannot be unjust with other FTU’ers. We hope you understand.

**Course Frequency?**

We all friends are colleagues and we too have our own day to day daily life to live and struggle, there is no specific time or day of course posting…. Sometimes we bulk Rip and leave it to the B0t and sometimes we just live our personal lives. We’re human, we cannot SiteRip Udemy and just take a world tour! Let Udemy platform and their valuable instructors take the ride for you, let em earn some good amount of money out of their course. 🙂
