#### Description

If you’re looking to get started building full-stack applications with **Vue 3** (or Vue 2) and Firebase, then look no further. In this course I’ll take you from novice to ninja in Vue JS 3, starting out with the very basics and then moving on towards creating fully-fledged Vue applications.

We’ll spend a whole chapter learning about the Vue Router – and how to create SPA’s (single page applications) using it – as well as exploring how to use the Vue CLI to get up and running quickly when creating slightly larger Vue applications.

**We’ll also dive deep into the newest features Vue 3 has to offer, including a lot about the Composition API & Composable Functions.**

I’ll also teach you how to use **Firebase** – an online & free service provided by Google which will act as a feature-rich back-end to our Vue applications.

We’ll learn how to use Firebase to store and retrieve real-time data to and from a NoSQL database called Firestore, as well as authenticate our app’s users with the Firebase Auth service, We’ll also take a peak at Firebase Storage (which will enable us to allow users to upload images on our Vue sites), as well as deploying all of our applications to Firebase hosting.

**Along the way we’ll create several full projects**, **_Web Apps with Vue JS 3_** including a reaction timer, project tracker, a blog, a real-time chatroom & a music playlist website.

There’s a crazy amount to cover, but by the end of this course you’ll be in a position to create full-stack web applications (complete with user authentication) using Vue 3 and Firebase!
