**What’s this course about?**

Learn React or dive deeper into it. Learn the theory, solve assignments, practice in demo projects and build one big application which is improved throughout the course: The Burger Builder!

**More details please!**

JavaScript is the **major driver** of modern web applications since it’s the only programming language which runs in the browser and hence allows you to provide highly reactive apps. You’ll be able to achieve mobile-app like user experiences in the web.

But using JavaScript **can be challenging** – it quickly becomes overwhelming to create a nice web app with vanilla JavaScript and jQuery only.

**React to the rescue!**

**React is all about components** – basically custom HTML elements – with which you can quickly build amazing and powerful web apps. Just build a component once, configure it to your needs, dynamically pass data into it (or listen to your own events!) and re-use it as often as needed.

Need to display a list of users in your app? It’s as simple as creating a “User” component and outputting it as often as needed.

This course will **start at the very basics** and explain what exactly React is and how you may use it (and for which kind of apps). Thereafter, we’ll go all the way **from basic to advanced**. We’ll not just scratch the surface but dive deeply into React as well as popular libraries like react-router and Redux.

By the end of the course, you can build amazing React (single page) applications!

A detailed list with the course content can be found below.

**Who’s teaching you in this course?**

My name is Maximilian Schwarzmüller, I’m a freelance web developer and worked with React in many projects. I’m also a 5-star rated instructor here on Udemy. I cover React’s most popular alternatives – Vue and Angular – as well as many other topics. I know what I’m talking about and I know where the pain points can be found.

It’s my goal to get you started with React as quick as possible and ensure your success. But I don’t just focus on students getting started. I want everyone to benefit from my courses, that’s why we’ll dive deeply into React and why I made sure to also share knowledge that’s helpful to advanced React developers.

**Is this course for you?**

This course is for you if …

-   …you’re just getting started with frontend/ JavaScript development and only got the JS basics set (no prior React or other framework experience is required!)
-   …you’re experienced with Angular or Vue but want to dive into React
-   …know the React basics but want to refresh them and/ or dive deeper
-   …already worked quite a bit with React but want to dive deeper and see it all come together in a bigger app

**What should you bring to succeed in that course?**

-   HTML + CSS + JavaScript knowledge is required. You don’t need to be an expert but the basics need to be set
-   NO advanced JavaScript knowledge is required, though you’ll be able to move even quicker through the course if you know next-gen JavaScript features like ES6 Arrow functions. **A short refresher about the most important next-gen features is provided in the course though.**
