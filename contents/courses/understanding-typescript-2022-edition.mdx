## **Don’t limit the Usage of TypeScript to Angular! Learn the Basics, its Features, Workflows and how to use it!**

**What you’ll learn**

-   Use TypeScript and its Features like Types, ES6 Support, Classes, Modules, Interfaces and much more in any of their Projects
-   Understand what TypeScript really is about and how it works
-   Why TypeScript offers a real advantage over vanilla JavaScript
-   Learn TypeScript both in theory as well as applied to real use-cases and projects
-   Learn how to combine TypeScript with ReactJS or NodeJS / Express

**Requirements**

-   JavaScript knowledge is required, though you don’t need to be an Expert
-   NO prior TypeScript experience is required
-   ES6 Knowledge is a plus but not required

#### **Description**

**This course was completely updated, reflects the latest version of TypeScript and incorporated tons of student feedback.**

—

Most People know TypeScript from Angular 2+. It’s the Language you have to use there, right?

**It’s more than that!**

Learn what TypeScript is, why it really is a **powerful Addition to JavaScript**, what its Features are and how to use it! And whilst doing so, also **understand what you’re actually doing in your Angular 2 Code.**

This Course takes you from the **very Basics** and its most **important Feature** (Types!) to the Point where you’re able to **use TypeScript in any of your Projects**. **ReactJS** Projects included!

As TypeScript is developed by **Microsoft** and strongly advertised used by **Angular 2+ (Google)**, it’s **here to stay**.

**Gain an Edge today and be amongst the First to really understand TypeScript!**

**A Journey into the Future**

As TypeScript code can be compiled to ES5, you’ll be amazed by the many **next-gen Features** you can start using Today. Be it ES6 Features like Destructuring or Arrow Functions, Decorators, Generics and Interfaces or Modules – TypeScript has them all!

In this Course, **we’ll not stop after the Basics**. You will learn about more **advanced Features** and also how to set up **Workflows with TypeScript**. This includes a TypeScript-only Workflow as well as Workflows using **Gulp** or **Webpack**.

You’ll also learn that you’re **not limited to Angular 2+** or plain JavaScript/ TypeScript Projects. A complete Module covers how to **use TypeScript with ReactJS** to benefit from its Features, there, too.

**Practice what you Learn**

Watching Videos is a great Way to Learn. And to a lot of Students, it’s the best Way. If you also want to practice the Things you learn, this Course offers you Exercises (and Solutions) in many of the Course Modules.

**So much Content!**

I’m not a Fan of these Courses which teach you the Basics and then leave you alone. In this Course you’ll get insights into:

-   Types and how to use them
-   How the TypeScript Compiler works
-   ES6 Features in TypeScript
-   Classes in TypeScript
-   Namespaces and Modules
-   Interfaces
-   Generics
-   Decorators
-   How to integrate Third-Party JavaScript Libraries into your TypeScript Project
-   How to set up a TypeScript project with Webpack
-   Or how to set up a plain-TypeScript Workflow
-   How to use TypeScript together with ReactJS
-   How to use TypeScript together with Node/ Express
-   Real projects and use-cases!

**Who this course is for:**

-   This Course is for every student who wants to extend his or her horizon beyond vanilla JavaScript
-   Everyone learning Angular should definitely understand how TypeScript works
