This course is focused on efficiency and getting you hired by building your dream portfolio so you can get a job or work as a freelancer. Never spend time on confusing, out of date, incomplete tutorials anymore! **Graduates of Andreiâ€™s courses are now working at Google, Tesla, Amazon, Apple, IBM, JP Morgan, Facebook, + other top tech companies** _(seriously, google this to verify some testimonials)._

Whether you want to become a freelancer, get hired, or to just advance your career, **this brand new course will take you step by step through 20 JavaScript projects that you will be able to customize and put on your portfolio right away.** Along the way, you will learn to build projects using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and truly build your skills as a JavaScript developer.

Whether you want to one day learn React, Angular, Vue JS, Node.js, Svelte, or any other toolchain of a modern developer, at the end of the day, JavaScript fundamentals are key, and learning JavaScript is an investment that will pay off many years into the future. By solidifying your JavaScript knowledge and being able to build thing without crutches like libraries and frameworks, you will future proof yourself.

Here is the truth: Itâ€™s easy to find JavaScript projects to work on online. You can copy and paste code. You can watch YouTube videos. Thatâ€™s simple _(and free)_. This course is different in that not only de we have modern projects using the latest features of JavaScript, and browser APIs, **but we also do a Code Review of each project.** After we build a website, we go through the code and talk about how we can improve the code, how to improve the security, or improve the performance of your projects.

**Itâ€™s like having a senior developer finally teach you what good code means, what are the common mistakes beginners make, and how toÂ  write maintainable code.**

All code is going to be provided to you, and even if you donâ€™t like to code along, you will get access to the code for the projects to put them on your portfolio right away.

So what are we building? Get ready for this:

The course is not about making you just code along without understanding the principles so that when you are done with the course you donâ€™t know what to do other than watch another tutorial. No! **This course will push you and challenge you to go from an absolute beginner in JavaScript to someone that is able to build projects on their own.**

AndreiÂ Neagoie is the instructor of the **highest rated Development courses on Udemy as well asÂ one of the fastestÂ growing.**Â His graduates haveÂ movedÂ on to work forÂ some of the biggest techÂ companies around the world like Apple, Google, Amazon, JP Morgan, IBM, UNIQLO etcâ€¦Â HeÂ hasÂ been working as a senior software developer inÂ Silicon Valley and Toronto for many years,Â andÂ is now taking all that he has learned,Â to teachÂ programming skills andÂ to help youÂ discover the amazing career opportunities that being a developer allows inÂ life.

Having beenÂ a self taught programmer,Â he understands that there is anÂ overwhelming number of online courses, tutorials and booksÂ that are overly verbose and inadequate at teaching proper skills.Â Most people feel paralyzed and donâ€™t know where to start when learning a complex subject matter, or even worse, most people donâ€™t have $20,000 to spend on a coding bootcamp.Â **Programming skills should be affordable and open to all. An education materialÂ should teach real life skills that are current andÂ they should not waste a studentâ€™s valuable time.**Â Â  Having learned importantÂ lessons from working for Fortune 500 companies, tech startups, to evenÂ founding his own business, he is now dedicating 100% of his time toÂ teaching others valuableÂ software development skillsÂ in order to take control of their life and work in an exciting industry with infinite possibilities.

Andrei promises you that there are no other courses out there as comprehensive and as well explained.Â **He believes that in order to learn anything of value, you need to start with the foundation and develop the roots of the tree. Only from there will you be able to learn concepts and specific skills(leaves) that connect to the foundation. Learning becomes exponential when structured in this way.**

Taking his experience in educational psychology and coding, Andreiâ€™s courses will take you on an understanding of complex subjects that you never thought would be possible.
