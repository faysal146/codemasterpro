#### **Description**

**_Always bet on Javascript!_**

For years, top recruiters in industry have hired fresh engineers based solely on their knowledge of Javascript.  **_If you want to get a programming job, this is the language to learn!_** But learning Javascript is complicated!  There’s fancy syntax, weird design patterns, and a billion resources online that might be giving you wrong – or even be out of date – information.

**We built this course to solve your problems.**  This is the best and most up-to-date resource online for becoming a Javascript professional as quickly as possible. Every minute of this course has been created with one goal in mind: teaching you how to become a great engineer.

**The New Modern Javascript Bootcamp (2020)** focuses on cutting through unnecessary information and giving you just the facts, plain and simple.  You won’t work with outdated frameworks, learn old styles of programming, or build boring apps.  Instead, you’ll only spend time writing practical code that can be used *today* *and in the future* on your own projects.  You’ll learn – from very early on in the course – how to write beautiful and reusable code that you’ll be proud to show to a future employer.

**Two of Udemy’s greatest instructors – Colt Steele and Stephen Grider – collaborated to create this course**.  Between the two of us, we have taught over **one million** engineers how to program.  Rest assured, you will be learning from the best.  We know how challenging it can be to understand a new programming from scratch, so we designed this course to offer you a step-by-step, guaranteed approach to becoming a Javascript master.

**—— Course Structure ——**

This course is divided into two parts.  The first half of the course focuses on teaching you the basic syntax of Javascript.  **Colt will walk you through core topics effortlessly**, imparting jewels of JS wisdom along the way.  Included in the first half of the course are many programming exercises and small projects, so you can test your new-found knowledge out.  Each of these videos can be easily referenced in the future, so you can always come back and brush up on some topic whenever needed.

The second half of the course is focused on building some amazing projects.  Stephen will show you how to build some production-ready Javascript applications, *including a fully-featured E-Commerce web app*!  These **projects are all styled to be absolutely beautiful**, visually stunning apps that you will be proud to feature on your own personal portfolio.  The main goal of these projects is to **highlight design patterns**, and show you the ‘right’ and ‘wrong’ ways of writing code.  By the end, you’ll be confident enough to work on your own personal projects with speed and finesse.

**—— What You’ll Learn ——**

This is a *long* course, with just about every fact about Javascript you could ever hope to know.  Here’s a *brief* subset of the topics you’ll cover:

-   Master the **basics of the language**, easily understanding variables, objects, arrays, and functions
-   Understand how to **design the structure** of the code you write, leading to beautiful and easy-to-read programs
-   Leverage Javascript’s built-in methods to **increase your productivity** regardless of what libraries or frameworks you use
-   Develop practical skills around **higher-order** **functions** that you will utilize for years to come

-   **Fetch and manage** information from third-party API’s

This is the **ultimate** Javascript course.  There are many resources online for learning Javascript, but this is the only one that covers everything you need to know, from ‘A’ to ‘Z’, and a couple letters after that.  Master the basics with Colt, then build awesome projects with Stephen. **We’ve taught a million other engineers how to code, and now it is your turn!**
